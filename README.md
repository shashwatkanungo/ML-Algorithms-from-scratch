# 🧠 ML Algorithms From Scratch

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch** repository!  
This project demonstrates the core logic behind popular ML algorithms without relying on high-level libraries — just `NumPy` and a love for learning. ✨

## 📌 Implemented Algorithms

### 1. 🔢 Linear Regression
- Predicts continuous values using the least squares method.
- Supports simple and multivariate linear regression.
- Includes visualization of regression line.

### 2. 🔁 Logistic Regression
- Binary classification using the sigmoid function and cross-entropy loss.
- Gradient descent optimization.
- Visualizes decision boundary on 2D datasets.

### 3. 🧠 Neural Network (Feedforward)
- Fully connected neural network with:
  - Forward pass
  - Backpropagation
  - Sigmoid activation
- Can learn XOR problem or any non-linear patterns.
- Includes loss plot over epochs.

### 4. 🌈 Polynomial Regression
- Fits non-linear data using polynomial feature expansion.
- Uses the Normal Equation for fitting.
- Visualizes curve fit.

### 5. 📊 Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
- Assumes feature independence and Gaussian distribution.
- Computes class-wise priors, means, and variances.
- Visualizes decision boundary for 2D data.

### 6. 🧲 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Implements hard-margin SVM using gradient descent.
- Maximizes margin between classes.
- Visualizes decision boundary and support vectors.

### 7. 🎯 K-Means Clustering
- Unsupervised clustering with `k` centroids.
- Includes:
  - Random centroid initialization
  - Point-to-centroid distance calculation
  - Early stopping based on centroid shifts
- Visualizes final clusters and centroids.
